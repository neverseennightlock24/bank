# bank
A full bank simulator with memory from previous interactions.

The bank file itself contains multiple options to manage your money, including abilities to transfer money between users. The JSON file holds all of the user's data, ensuring that financial information is saved and available for whenever the user re-opens the program.

The JSON file currently holds memory for a demo user named 'Bob' who changed his account name to 'Mark.'

Feel free to completely delete that code if you'd like to remove Mark and start fresh, as the Python file will automatically populate the JSON with your new user(s) information.
